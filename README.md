# JP Morgan Cash Flow Data Polynomial Fitting
Polynomial fitting of time series data involves using polynomial functions to approximate and model the underlying trend within the data. This method aims to capture the overall pattern or shape of the time series by fitting a polynomial equation to the data points. The degree of the polynomial determines the complexity of the model, with higher degrees offering more flexibility but risking overfitting. Polynomial fitting can be useful for smoothing noisy data, identifying long-term trends, or making short-term predictions. However, it's important to be cautious of overfitting and to consider the appropriateness of the polynomial degree based on the characteristics of the data and the desired modeling goals.
